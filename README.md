# parallelconsumer


In this example, the `ParallelConsumer` is created as a bean in the application context with the necessary configurations. A method annotated with `@KafkaListener` is used to define the message processing logic. The `ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory` bean is used to set up the Kafka listener container with the necessary consumer configurations. Finally, a `KafkaTemplate` bean is used to produce messages to the Kafka topic.

Note that you will need to replace the placeholder values in the `application.properties` file with your actual Kafka configuration values.
